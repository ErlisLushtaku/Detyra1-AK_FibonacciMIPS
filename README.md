# Detyra1-AK_FibonacciMIPS

The task was to implement the equivalent program of the Fibonacci sequence program written in C++ using MIPS assembly language. The program written in C++, the equivalent assembly language program, a detailed explanation about both programs and testing screenshots are provided in the files: [Detyra1-AK-2021.pdf](https://github.com/ErlisLushtaku/Detyra1-AK_FibonacciMIPS/files/8457635/Detyra1-AK-2021.pdf), [raporti-OpsioniA_ErlisLushtaku.pdf](https://github.com/ErlisLushtaku/Detyra1-AK_FibonacciMIPS/files/8457819/raporti-OpsioniA_ErlisLushtaku.pdf).
